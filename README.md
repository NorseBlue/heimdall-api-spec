Apart from guard duty, Heimdall is the ever-watchful sentinel who waits with his horn to announce the end of the world.

Heimdall is a secure User Management System to serve as a single endpoint to manage user accounts and permissions for various applications.

The system is built as a RESTful API service to expose the functionality to multiple platforms and devices.
